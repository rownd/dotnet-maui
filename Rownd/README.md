# Rownd SDK for .NET MAUI

The Rownd SDK for .NET MAUI provides authentication, account and user profile management, deep linking, and more for cross-platform MAUI apps.

Using the Rownd platform, you can easily bring the same authentication that's on your website to your mobile apps. Or if you only authenticate users on your mobile apps, you can streamline the authentication process using Rownd's passwordless sign-in links, enabling you to seamlessly authenticate users from an app link sent to their email or phone number.

Once a user is authenticated, you can retrieve and update their profile information on the fly using native APIs. Leverage Rownd's pre-built mobile app components to give users profile management tools. Additionally, you can manage encryption of data on-device before sending it back to Rownd or your own backend.

## Getting started

### Prerequisites

- .NET 8 or higher
- Android API 26 or higher (Android 8+)
- iOS/iPadOS 14 or higher

### Installation

Rownd provides a single library that works across iOS, Android, and Mac Catalyst.

In your app project and any platform-specific projects, add a NuGet dependency on `Rownd.Maui`.

```bash
dotnet add package Rownd.Maui
```

## Usage

### Initialize the SDK

In your main app project, open the main entry point (usually `MauiProgram.cs`) and add the `UseRownd()` build step to your builder initialization. This allows Rownd to register view handlers or other required native hooks. Yours might look something like this:

```C#
using CommunityToolkit.Maui;
using Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Compatibility.Hosting;
using Rownd.Maui.Utils;

namespace RowndMauiExample;

public static class RowndMauiExample
{
    public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
    {
        var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();
        builder
            .UseMauiCompatibility()
            .UseMauiApp<App>()
            .UseMauiCommunityToolkit()
            .UseRownd();    // <-- This is the important bit!

        return builder.Build();
    }
}

```

Next, in your `App.xaml.cs` file, initialize the Rownd SDK and save a reference to it. Again, your code might look similar to this example:

```C#
using Rownd.Maui;

namespace RowndMauiExample
{
    public partial class App : Application
    {
        public RowndInstance Rownd;

        public App()
        {
            Rownd = RowndInstance.GetInstance(this);
            Rownd.Configure("YOUR_APP_KEY");

            InitializeComponent();

            MainPage = new AppShell();
        }
    }
}

```

If you're using `DependencyService`, you might want to add Rownd to make it easily accessible across the project:

```C#
DependencyService.RegisterSingleton<IRowndInstance>(Rownd);
```

### Handling authentication state

Rownd leverages the concept of observables so that your app can react to changes in state without requiring complex logic.

Generally, you'll want to listen to updates from Rownd's state and then trigger actions (e.g., navigating to a new page) or update properties on your ViewModels based on the changed values.

Here's an example of a ViewModel that subscribes to the authentication state. A XAML view might adjust its layout based on `AuthState.IsAuthenticated`.

```C#
namespace RowndMauiExample.ViewModels
{
    public class ExampleViewModel : BaseViewModel
    {
        public IRowndInstance Rownd => DependencyService.Get<IRowndInstance>();
        
        public AuthState AuthState { get; set; }
        
        public ExampleViewModel()
        {
            Rownd.Store.Select(state => state.Auth).Subscribe((authState) =>
            {
                AuthState = authState;
                OnPropertyChanged("AuthState");
            });
        }
    }
}
```

Once the state subscription is initialized, the lambda function will fire any time a change in state occurs that is different from the previous state.

The following properties are available as portions of the state:

#### `.AuthState`

```C#
class AuthState
{
    public string AccessToken { get; }
    public string RefreshToken { get; }
    public bool IsAuthenticated { get; }
    public bool IsAccessTokenValid { get; }
}
```

#### `.UserState`

```C#
class UserState
{
    public string Id { get; }
    public Dictionary<string, dynamic> Data { get; }
}
```

## Logging

The Rownd SDK logs errors and warnings in addition to informational and debug
messages using the `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging` library. This gives you 
control over which Rownd messages are interleaved into your own logs.

We strongly enable recommending logs for at least Warning severities and higher,
as this will help you catch and debug issues during development and may also
be helpful when troubleshooting problems in production.

To enable logging, pass an instance of `ILoggerFactory` to
`Rownd.Maui.Utils.Loggers.SetLogFactory()` during the bootstrapping of your app.
For example, in `MauiProgram.cs`:

```c#
public static MauiApp CreateMauiApp()
{
    var builder = MauiApp.CreateBuilder();

    builder.UseSharedMauiApp();

    var app = builder.Build();

    var loggerFactory = app.Services.GetService<ILoggerFactory>();
    Rownd.Maui.Utils.Loggers.SetLogFactory(loggerFactory);  // <--- pass your app's ILoggerFactory

    return app;
}
```

By default, you'll start seeing logs for whatever your app's minimum logging
level is set to. To filter Rownd logs for only warnings and higher, modify
your Maui app build phase along these lines:

```c#
public static MauiAppBuilder UseSharedMauiApp(this MauiAppBuilder builder)
{
    builder.Services.AddLogging(
        configure =>
        {
            configure.SetMinimumLevel(LogLevel.Trace);  // <--- `trace` logs for your app
            configure.AddFilter("rownd", LogLevel.Warning);   // <--- `warning` logs from Rownd
            configure.AddDebug();
            configure.AddConsole();
        }
    );

    builder
        .UseMauiCompatibility()
        .UseMauiApp<App>()
        .UseMauiCommunityToolkit()
        .UseRownd();

    // TODO: Add the entry points to your Apps here.
    // See also: https://learn.microsoft.com/dotnet/maui/fundamentals/app-lifecycle
    builder.Services.AddTransient<AppShell>();

    return builder;
}
```

## API reference

In addition to the state APIs, Rownd provides imperative APIs that you can call to request sign in, get and retrieve user profile information, retrieve a current access token, and so on.

### `void Rownd.RequestSignIn()`
Opens the Rownd sign-in dialog to begin authentication.


### `void Rownd.RequestSignIn(new RowndSignInOpts(...))`
Opens the Rownd sign-in dialog for authentication, as before, but allows passing additional context options as shown below.

`Intent (Not recommended): RowndSignInIntent` - This option applies only when you have opted to split the sign-up/sign-in flow via the Rownd dashboard. Valid values are .SignIn or .SignUp. If you donâ€™t set this value, the user will be presented with the unified sign-in/sign-up flow. Please reach out to support@rownd.io to enable.

`PostSignInRedirect (Not recommended): String` - If a subdomain is provided in the Rownd dashboard, this behavior will work by default. When the user completes the authentication challenge via email or SMS, they'll be redirected to the URL set for postSignInRedirect. If this is an Android App Link, it will redirect the user back to your app.

Example:

```C#
Rownd.RequestSignIn(new RowndSignInOpts(
    Intent = RowndSignInIntent.SignUp
));
```

### `void ManageAccount()`
Opens the Rownd user-facing profile editor, enabling the user to change information associated with them (e.g., email, phone, names, passkeys, etc.).

### `void ManageAccount(new RowndManageAccountOpts(...))`
Opens the Rownd user-facing profile editor, enabling the user to change information associated with them (e.g., email, phone, names, passkeys, etc.).

Supports additional context items as shown below.

`VisibleProfileFields: string[]` - Array of field names that limit what should be shown on the profile editor. These names should match the Rownd app schema.

Example:

```C#
Rownd.ManageAccount(new RowndManageAccountOpts {
    VisibleProfileFields = { "email", "phone_number" }
});
```

### `async Task<string> Rownd.GetAccessToken()`
Assuming a user is signed-in, returns a valid access token, refreshing the current one if needed. If an access token cannot be returned due to a temporary condition (e.g., inaccessible network), this function will throw. If an access token cannot be returned because the refresh token is invalid, null will be returned and the Rownd authentication state will flip to `IsAuthenticated = false`.

### `async Task<string> Rownd.GetAccessToken(token: String)`
When possible, exchanges a non-Rownd access token for a Rownd access token. This is primarily used in scenarios where an app is migrating from some other authentication mechanism to Rownd. Using Rownd integrations, the system will accept a third-party token. If it successfully validates, Rownd will sign-in the user and return a fresh Rownd access token to the caller.

This API returns null if the token could not be validated and exchanged. If that occurs, it's likely that the user should sign-in normally via Rownd.requestSignIn().

> NOTE: This API is typically used once. After a Rownd token is available, other tokens should be discarded.

Example:

```C#
    // Assume `oldToken` was retrieved from some prior authenticator.
    var accessToken = await Rownd.GetAccessToken(oldToken);

    if (accessToken != null) {
        // Navigate to the UI that an authenticated user should typically see
    } else {
        Rownd.RequestSignIn()
    }
```

> NOTE: The following user profile APIs technically accept `dynamic` as the value of a field. However, that value **must** be serializable using the [Newtonsoft JSON.NET library](https://www.newtonsoft.com/json). If the value is not serializable out of the box, you'll need to serialize it to a string prior to storing it in the user object, then deserialize it when getting it back out.

### `Dictionary<string, dynamic> Rownd.User.Get()`
Returns the entire user profile as a Dictionary

### `<T> Rownd.User.Get<T>(field: string)`
Returns the value of a specific field in the user's data Dictionary. "id" is a special case that will return the user's ID, even though it's technically not in the Dictionary itself.

Your application code is responsible for knowing which type the value should cast to. If the cast fails or the entry doesn't exist, a null value will be returned.

### `void Rownd.User.Set(data: Dictionary<string, dynamic>)`
Replaces the user's data with that contained in the Dictionary. This may overwrite existing values, but must match the schema you defined within your Rownd application dashboard.

### `void Rownd.User.Set(field: string, value: dynamic)`
Sets a specific user profile field to the provided value, overwriting if a value already exists.
